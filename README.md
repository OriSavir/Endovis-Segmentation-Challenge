This is an attempt at the Endovis medical tool segmentation challenge.
The submission compares the performance of architectures such as U-Net, DeepLab (and variations, such as the impact of ResNet integration within those architectures).
Techniques such as transfer learning via weights trained on non-surgical images was also demonstrated to be effective. 
Overall results were summarized in a paper submission.
